🔧 Unbound DNS Installation Guide for Windows

This guide walks you through installing and configuring Unbound — a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver — on Windows. Most tutorials focus on Linux, so this tutorial can help to fills the gap for Windows users.
🖥️ System Info
This setup was tested on:
💻 Hardware: Intel i3-8100T (HP ProDesk 400), 8GB RAM
🪟 OS: Windows 10 Pro
🧠 Future use: Integrated with Pi-hole running on Raspberry Pi 3


📥 1. Download Unbound
Install the latest Windows version:
🔗 Unbound Setup 
https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/download/
The default install location is:
<pre> C:\Program Files\Unbound\ </pre>


🌐 2. Download Root Hints File
The root.hints file is a list of root DNS server IP addresses used by Unbound to start recursive DNS resolution from scratch.
📥 To download:
```
    https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root
```
Save the file as root.hints
Move it to:
<pre>
C:\Program Files\Unbound\ 
</pre>


🔑 3. Generate root.key for DNSSEC
The root.key file is used by Unbound to validate DNSSEC signatures from the root zone.
🛠 Steps:
Open an elevated Command Prompt (Run as Administrator), and go to:
```
cd "C:\Program Files\Unbound"
```
and run:
```
unbound-anchor.exe -a "C:\Program Files\Unbound\root.key"
```
This generates root.key in the Unbound folder.


⚙️ 4. Modify service.conf Configuration File
Open the C:\Program Files\Unbound\service.conf file in your preferred editor (e.g., Notepad). Replace its contents with the one of the following config mode:

UNBOUND - RECURSIVE MODE
```

```
💡 Note: If port 53 is already in use (e.g., by Pi-hole), change it to another port and reflect that in your DNS setup later.


🔁 5. Restart Unbound Service
Open an elevated Command Prompt and run:
```
net stop Unbound
```
then
```
net start Unbound
```

If Unbound fails to start, check the config with:
```
unbound-checkconf "C:\Program Files\Unbound\service.conf"
```


🧪 6. Test DNS Resolution
Open Command Prompt and run:
<pre>
nslookup google.com 127.0.0.1
</pre>
If Unbound is working correctly, it will return the IP address of google.com.

🧪 7. Test DNSSEC 
Go to:
```
https://dnscheck.tools/
```
or
```
https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/encrypted-sni/
```

🌐 8. Integrate Unbound with Router or Pi-hole (if available)
You can now point your router or Pi-hole to your Unbound server as the DNS resolver.

Example:
If your Unbound server IP is 192.168.1.252 and port is 53, then in Pi-hole DNS settings, set:
Custom DNS: 192.168.1.252#53
or
If you don't use Pi-Hole, you can just put the Unbound server IP into your DNS IP in your router.


🔄 9. Restart Pi-hole
Restart Pi-hole’s DNS resolver or reboot the device to apply the changes.

✅ Done!
You now have a fully working Unbound DNS resolver on Windows, acting as a secure and private DNS backend for your Pi-hole or home network. 🎉

Thank You.
